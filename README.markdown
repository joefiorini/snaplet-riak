# snaplet-riak

A Snaplet for using Riak with the Snap Framework.

Used in a manner very similar to 
[snaplet-postgresql-simple](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/snaplet-postgresql-simple)

Sadly, I decided soon after starting this project to move off Riak, and I've
therefore stopped maintaining it. If you would like to take over, please let
me know.
